# CIvsVM study in precense of Asocial Behavior

This repository contains the codes used in the study: "Cross-inhibition leads to group consensus despite the presence of strongly opinionated minorities and asocial behaviour" by Andreagiovanni Reina, Raina Zakir, Eliseo Ferrante, and Giulia De Masi.

The code is organised as follows:

* **GillespieSimulation:** code to run the Gillespie algorithm for both voter and cross inhibition model 
* **EqNoiseCI** code to generate heatmaps for cross-inhibition in Fig 2.
* **EqNoiseVM** code to generate heatmaps for voter model in Fig 2.
* **EqBifCiVM:** code of to generate heatmaps and SPD plots for Fig 1 and Fig 4.
* **UpdateCodeAverages:** code to find the average time of consensus in Gillespie simulation.
* **UpdatedCodeMST:**  code to plot MST based on Gillespie simulations for Fig 4.
* **swarm_robotics_experiments:** code to run experiments on Kilobots.
* **Mathematical Notebooks:**  notebook to reproduce the stability and bifurcation analysis that we have done on the ODE model.
